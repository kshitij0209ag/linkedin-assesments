## Python (Programming Language)

#### Q1. What is an abstract class?

- [ ] An abstract class is the name for any class from which you can instantiate an object.
- [ ] Abstract classes must be redefined any time an object is instantiated from them.
- [ ] Abstract classes must inherit from concrete classes.

#### Q64. What would happen if you did not alter the state of the element that an algorithm is operating on recursively?

- [ ] You do not have to alter the state of the element the algorithm is recursing on.
- [ ] You would eventually get a KeyError when the recursive portion of the code ran out of items to recurse on.
- [x] You would get a RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded.
- [ ] The function using recursion would return None.

#### Q65. What is the runtime complexity of searching for an item in a binary search tree?

- [ ] The runtime for searching in a binary search tree is O(1) because each node acts as a key, similar to a dictionary.
- [ ] The runtime for searching in a binary search tree is O(n!) because every node must be compared to every other node.
- [x] The runtime for searching in a binary search tree is generally O(h), where h is the height of the tree.
- [ ] The runtime for searching in a binary search tree is O(n) because every node in the tree must be visited.

#### Q66. Why would you use `mixin`?

- [ ] You use a `mixin` to force a function to accept an argument at runtime even if the argument wasn't included in the function's definition.
- [ ] You use a `mixin` to allow a decorator to accept keyword arguments.
- [ ] You use a `mixin` to make sure that a class's attributes and methods don't interfere with global variables and functions.
- [x] If you have many classes that all need to have the same functionality, you'd use a `mixin` to define that functionality.

#### Q67. What is the runtime complexity of adding an item to a stack and removing an item from a stack?

- [ ] Add items to a stack in O(1) time and remove items from a stack on O(n) time.
- [x] Add items to a stack in O(1) time and remove items from a stack in O(1) time.
- [ ] Add items to a stack in O(n) time and remove items from a stack on O(1) time.
- [ ] Add items to a stack in O(n) time and remove items from a stack on O(n) time.

#### Q68. What does calling namedtuple on a collection type return?

- [x] a tuple subclass with iterable named fields
- [ ] a generic object class with non-iterable named fields
- [ ] a generic object class with iterable parameter fields
- [ ] a tuple subclass with non-iterable parameter fields

#### Q69. Which statement accurately describes how items are added to and remnoved from a stack?

- [ ] a stacks adds items to one side and removes items from the other side.
- [x] a stacks adds items to the top and removes items from the top.
- [ ] a stacks adds items to the top and removes items from anywhere in the stack.
- [ ] a stacks adds items to either end and removes items from either end.

#### Q70. What is a base case in a recursive function?

- [x] A base case is the condition that allows the algorithm to stop recursing. It is usually a problem that is small enough to solve directly.
- [ ] The base case is summary of the overall problem that needs to be solved.
- [ ] The base case is passed in as an argument to a function whose body makes use of recursion.
- [ ] The base case is similar to a base class, in that it can be inherited by another object.

#### Q71. Why is it considered good practice to open a file from within a Python script by using the `with` keyword?

- [ ] The `with` keyword lets you choose which application to open the file in.
- [ ] The `with` keyword acts like a `for` loop, and lets you access each line in the file one by one.
- [ ] There is no benefit to using the `with` keyword for opening a file in Python.
- [x] When you open a file using the `with` keyword in Python, Python will make sure the file gets closed, even if an exception or error is thrown.

#### Q72. Why would you use a virtual environment?

- [x] Virtual environments create a "bubble" around your project so that any libraries or packages you install within it don't affect your entire machine.
- [ ] Teams with remote employees use virtual environments so they can share code, do code reviews, and collaorate remotely.
- [ ] Virtual environments were common in Python 2 because they augmented missing features in the language. Virtual environments are not necessary in Python 3 due to advancements in the language.
- [ ] Virtual environments are tied to your GitHub or Bitbucket account, allowing you to access any of your repos virtually from any machine.

#### Q73. What is the correct way to run all the doctests in a given file from the command line?

- [ ] python3 -m doctest <filename>
- [x] python3 <filename>
- [ ] python3 <filename> rundoctests
- [ ] python3 doctest

#### Q74. What is a lambda function ?

- [ ] any function that makes use of scientific or mathematical constants, often represented by Greek letters in academic writing
- [ ] a function that get executed when decorators are used
- [ ] any function whose definition is contained within five lines of code or fewer
- [x] a small, anonymous function that can take any number of arguments but has only expression to evaluate

[Reference](https://www.guru99.com/python-lambda-function.html)

**Explanation:**
`the lambda notation is basically an anonymous function that can take any number of arguments with only single expression (i.e, cannot be overloaded). It has been introducted in other programming languages, such as C++ and Java. The lambda notation allows programmers to "bypass" function declaration.`

#### Q75. What is the primary difference between lists and tuples?

- [ ] You can access a specifc element in a list by indexing to its position, but you cannot access a specific element in a tuple unless you iterate through the tuple
- [x] Lists are mutable, meaning you can change the data that is inside them at any time. Tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot change the data that is inside them once you have created the tuple.
- [ ] Lists are immutable, meaning you cannot change the data that is inside them once you have created the list. Tuples are mutable, meaning you can change the data that is inside them at any time.
- [ ] Lists can hold several data types inside them at once, but tuples can only hold the same data type if multiple elements are present.

#### Q76. Which statement about static method is true?

- [ ] Static methods can be bound to either a class or an instance of a class.
- [ ] Static methods can access and modify the state of a class or an instance of a class.
- [x] Static methods serve mostly as utility or helper methods, since they cannot access or modify a class's state.
- [ ] Static methods are called static because they always return None.

#### Q77. What does a generator return?

- [ ] None
- [ ] An iterable object
- [ ] A linked list data structure from a non-empty list
- [ ] All the keys of the given dictionary

#### Q78. What is the difference between class attributes and instance attributes?

- [ ] Instance attributes can be changed, but class attributes cannot be changed
- [ ] Class attributes are shared by all instances of the class. Instance attributes may be unique to just that instance
- [ ] There is no difference between class attributes and instance attributes
- [ ] Class attributes belong just to the class, not to instance of that class. Instance attributes are shared among all instances of a class

#### Q79. What is the correct syntax of creating an instance method?

- [ ]

```python
def get_next_card():
  # method body goes here
```

- [x]

```python
def get_next_card(self):
  # method body goes here
```

- [ ]

```python
def self.get_next_card():
  # method body goes here
```

- [ ]

```python
def self.get_next_card(self):
  # method body goes here
```

#### Q80. What is a key difference between a set and a list?

- [ ] A set is an ordered collection of non-unique items. A list is an unordered collection of unique items.
- [ ] A set is an ordered collection of unique items. A list is an unordered collection of non-unique items.
- [ ] Elements can be retrieved from a list but they cannot be retrieved from a set.
- [ ] A set is an unordered collection of unique items. A list is an ordered collection of non-unique items.
