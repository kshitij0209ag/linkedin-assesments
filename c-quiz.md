## C (Programming Language) 

##### Q1. Which Code sample will eventually cause the computer to run out of memory ?
- [x] 
  ```c
  while(1)
  {
      char *smallString = (char *) malloc(10);
  }
  ```
- [ ] 
  ```c
  long long number = 1;
  while(1)
      number *= 2;
  ```
- [ ] 
  ```c

  {
      char hugeString[1000000L];
      memset(hugeString, 0, 1000000L);
  }
  ```

  ```

#### Q2. What will this code print on the screen?
```c
int f1 (int a, int b)
{
    if (a > b)
    {
        printf("A is greater than B\n");
        return 1;
    }
    else
    {
        printf("B is greater than A");
        return 0;
    }
}

        printf("C is fun!\n");
}
```

float g;
void *vptr=&g;
```
- [ ] f = _(float _)vptr;
- [ ] f = (float \*)vptr;
- [x] f = (float)\*vptr;

#### Q7. A C header file is a file with extension .h that contains function declarations and macro definitons to be shared between several source files. Header files are listed using the preprocessing directive #include, and can have one of the following formats: #include &lt;fileA&gt; or #include "fileB". What is the difference between these two formats?
- [ ] The preprocessor will try to locate the fileA in same directory as the source file, and the fileB in a predetermined directory path.
- [ ] The preprocessor will try to locate the fileA in the fixed system directory. It will try to locate fileB in the directory path designated by the -l option added to the command line while compiling the source code.
- [ ] The file using fileA syntax must be system files, of unlimited number. fileB must be a user file at a maximun of one per source file.
- [x] The preprocessor will try to locate the fileA in a predetermined directory path. It will try to locate fileB in the same directory as the source file along with a custom directory path.

#### Q8. Using a for loop, how could you write a C code to count down from 10 to 1 and display each number on its own line?
- [ ] 
  ```c
  for (int i = 0; i>=0, i--){
      printf("%d\n", i);
  }//end of loop
  ```
- [ ] 
  ```c
  int i;
  for (i=1; i<=10; i++){
      printf("%d", i);
  }
  ```
- [ ] 
  ```c
  int i = 10;
  while (i>0){
      printf("%d\n", i);
      i--;
  }
  ```
- [x] 
  ```c
  int i;
  for (i= 10; i>0; i--){
      printf("%d\n", i);
  }// end of loop

    else x=c;
    return(x);
}
```

}
```
- [ ] 32
- [ ] Runtime error
